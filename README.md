## Usage

To run all steps on all data:

    make

### Single dataset
To only download a single dataset:

    make FILE="documents.zip" download_single

See [whitelist.txt](https://github.com/andrewharvey/psma-admin-bdys-data/blob/master/whitelist.txt) for a list of datasets.

Then unpack and process with:

    make unpack process

## Make Targets

- **data/index.json**: Download a machine readable index of all resources avaliable at https://data.gov.au/dataset/psma-administrative-boundaries into `data/index.json`
- **download_all**: Download all PSMA Administrative Boundaries datasets into `data/resources`
- **download_single**: Download a single named dataset into `data/resources`
- **unpack**: Unzips all downloaded datasets into `data/resources_unzip`
- **process**: The source datasets are split into per state files with geometry and attributes in seperate files. This stage combines all states together into an Australia wide file and joins all attributes. Outputs to `data/outputs/shp`
- **pack**: Creates `.tar.xz` files of the `data/outputs/shp` files for easy distribution
- **clean**: Removes data/index.json only
